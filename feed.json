I obtained my PhD in 2019 from <a href=\"https://time.rwth-aachen.de/\">RWTH Aachen University</a> (Commission: Christian Hopp, Frank Piller, Oliver Salge). During my graduate studies and PhD, I was a visiting researcher at the <a href=\"https://cci.mit.edu/\">MIT Center for Collective Intelligence</a> at the <a href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/\">MIT Sloan School of Management</a> (Thomas Malone &amp; Peter Gloor) and Collective Learning Group at the <a href=\"https://media.mit.edu\">MIT Media Lab</a> (César Hidalgo). I studied at <a href=\"https://www.uni-wh.de/en/uwh-international/start/\">Witten/Herdecke University</a>, Germany, and was a visiting student at the <a href=\"https://mit.edu/\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, USA. I am a co-founder of the startup <a href=\"https://moviegalaxies.com/\">MovieGalaxies</a>, providing open source network data on <a href=\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/T4HBA3\">Harvard DataVerse</a>. In 2014-2015, I worked in a research project on data analytics in soccer for a Bundesliga club, specializing on complexity in passing networks. I further gained experienced working at central marketing at Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG, executive consulting with <a href=\"https://www.drgeorgfischer.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dr. Georg Th. Fischer</a>, and working in smaller consulting projects such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceLiner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">German Space Liner</a> (German Aerospace Center).</p>\n<p>Together with co-authors, I have published on using <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11187-019-00218-w\">machine leaning to predict outcomes in crowdfunding with text, speech, and video information</a>, on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2018.11.015\">predicting venture capital investments with crowdfunding data</a>, on <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusvent.2020.106021\">experimental studies of psychological distance in product crowdfunding</a>, and on <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/04/what-40-years-of-research-reveals-about-the-difference-between-disruptive-and-radical-innovation\">topic models of disruptive innovation research</a>.  My research with colleagues is cited in official reports by the Organisation for <em>Economic Co-operation and Development</em> (OECD) and the Publications Office of the European Union, particularly within the Joint Research Centre of the <em>European Commission</em>.</p>\n<p>I have been awarded the <em>Best Teacher </em>Award at my faculty and was nominated for the Wynand Wijnen Education Prize on university level. My PhD thesis (summa cum laude) received the <em>Borchers Badge</em> at RWTH Aachen. I was a Fellow of the <em>Royal Society of Arts</em> and <em>Marshall Memorial Fellow</em> at the Marshall Fund of the United States. In 2012 I was happy to be a participant in the first <em>Y Combinator Startup School</em> and winning a <em>Best Practice Paper</em> Award at Stanford Medicine X. My initiative Nachhaltigkeistspreis.de (Sustainability Award) was acquired by an initiative of the German Federal Government. Among my early adventures: serving as a UEFA Champions League 2004 Junior Journalist, where Jürgen Klinsmann and Eusébio presented me and three others with the award. Pure luck? Probably. Unforgettable? Absolutely.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

In recent years, interest has also grown in the business sector with both experimental (such as A/B testing, reinforcement learning, business experimentation) and observational causal inference methods (such causal discovery, root-cause analysis, quasi-experimental methods) being increasingly applied by practitioners. <br><br>Ever since its launch, the Causal Data Science Meeting has been at the forefront of this development, connecting a global audience of causality experts from academia and industry. We are excited to announce this year's Causal Data Science Meeting, which will take place as a two-day virtual conference on <em>November 12-13, 2025</em>. The event will focus on the newest methodological advances, practical aspects, and organizational challenges related to the adoption of causal machine learning tools. It will feature invited talks and presentations of accepted proposals.‍<br>‍<br><strong>Workshop Date:</strong><br>November 12–13<br><strong>Submission Deadline:</strong><br>September 30<br><strong>Acceptance Notification:<br></strong>October 7<br><br>Please submit your presentation proposal, extended abstract or full paper to <a href=\"mailto:submission@causalscience.org?subject=Submission%3A%20CDSM2025\"><strong>submission@causalscience.org</strong></a><br><br>The meeting is organized as a workshop for the purpose of facilitating discussion and disseminating ideas.
